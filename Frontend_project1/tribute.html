    <p>Dan Millman is a former world champion athlete, martial arts teacher, trainer and university professor.</p>
    <p>After 20 years of intensive spiritual search, the teachings took shape as the Way of the Pacific Warrior and are fully expressed in their books and classes. His work continually evolves to meet the needs of a continually changing world.</p>
    <p>Dan's fourteen books, including <span>The Way of the Pacific Warrior</span>, have inspired and informed millions of readers in more than 30 languages around the world. The film production <span> The Warrior's Road</span>, starring Nick Nolte, is an adaptation of Dan's first book, based on actual events that took place in his life.</p>
    <p>Dan spends much of his time writing and giving talks and conferences. His speech, seminars and workshops span all generations to reach out to men and women from all walks of life, including leaders in the fields of health, psychology, education, business, politics, sports, entertainment, and the arts.</p>
